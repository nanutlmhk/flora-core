# Flora Root

Cloud control plane for every tenant (one tenant = one hospital = one Canopy).

- **Tenants** with their own API key (Root stores only the hash).
- **License bundles**: modules, max Leaves, max gateways, max gateway devices and
  licensed device types, plus **global configuration**, signed with Ed25519.
- **Check-ins** from each Canopy's Haber with current usage.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build      # http://localhost:7100
```

| Endpoint | Caller |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/keys` | Haber: Root public signing key |
| `GET /api/v1/tenants/{id}/bundle` | Haber (Bearer tenant key): signed bundle |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants/{id}/heartbeat` | Haber: usage report |
| `POST /api/v1/tenants`, `PUT .../license`, `POST .../license/revoke`, `PUT /api/v1/global-config/{key}` | Root admin (`x-root-key` when `ROOT_ADMIN_KEY` is set) |
| `GET /api/v1/overview` | Root admin page |

Revocation and tenant suspension are delivered as a bundle with `expires_at = 0`,
so every tier enforces them the same way as expiry.

Before production: set `ROOT_ADMIN_KEY`, disable `ROOT_SEED_DEMO`, give each
Canopy the Root public key (`FLORA_ROOT_PUBLIC_KEY`), and keep the signing key in
a KMS/HSM instead of the database.
